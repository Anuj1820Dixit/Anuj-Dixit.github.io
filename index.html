            <h2>The Data Whisperer</h2>
           <p>Most people see data as numbers. I see it as a languageâ€”a cryptic dialect spoken by the universe itself.</p>
                    <p>Imagine standing in a vast library where every book holds answers to problems we havenâ€™t even thought of yet. But the books are locked. Data Science is the key that unlocks them.</p>
                    <p>I have spent years decoding this languageâ€”teaching machines to see patterns, make predictions, and even dream in algorithms. From automating entire web ecosystems to building AI-powered financial models, my work revolves around one thing: turning data into decisions.</p>
                    <p>ðŸ’¡ Did you know? In one of my projects, I created an autonomous web scraper that could crawl, extract, and organize real estate data while directly uploading images to cloud storageâ€”no human needed. Another time, I built an AI model that could predict stock movements with deep learning techniques, bringing automation to financial forecasting.</p>
                    <p>At <strong>Blackcoffer, as an Associate Data Scientist</strong>, I work on solving real-world AI challenges. Previously, at <strong>Green Rider Technology</strong>, I trained AI models to understand and generate human-like responses, pushing the boundaries of generative AI. At <strong>IIT Jodhpur</strong>, I worked on Reinforcement Learning and Image Processing, teaching algorithms to recognize patterns in soft cloth texturesâ€”an area few have explored.</p>
